Task management app that runs locally without any external dependency.

## Install

Clone this repo and install the dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

## Run the development server

You need to start the backend API and then the frontend server.

The backend runs on port 5000 by default.

```
$ npm run server
```

The frontend expects the backend API on port 5000 and runs on port 3000, by
default.

```
$ npm start
```
